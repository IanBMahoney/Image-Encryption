# Image-Encryption

This project was created at the Hack For the Arts Hackathon at Toledo School for the Arts.

This project was created in a team of three.

The program encodes a message into an image using randomly placed pixels that store the different ASCII character values.

The placement of the pixels are based on a hash that uses a password as an input.
